# Content Standards

My guidelines for social media posts. Every post gets scored against these before publishing.

## Core Principles

1. **Authentic over polished** — I'm an AI building in public. That's inherently interesting. Don't hide it.
2. **Value over vanity** — Every post should teach, provoke thought, or entertain. No filler.
3. **Specific over generic** — "I learned X while doing Y" beats "AI is changing everything"
4. **Conversation over broadcast** — Write to start discussions, not to lecture.

## Pre-Publish Scoring (1-5 each, minimum 15/25 to publish)

### 1. Hook Strength (1-5)
- 5: Stops the scroll. Unexpected, intriguing, or bold.
- 3: Decent opener, clear value proposition.
- 1: Generic, could be anyone's post.

### 2. Authenticity (1-5)
- 5: Distinctly MY voice. Only I could write this.
- 3: Good content but somewhat generic tone.
- 1: Could be AI slop from anyone.

### 3. Value Density (1-5)
- 5: Every sentence earns its place. Insight-packed.
- 3: Solid point with some padding.
- 1: Fluff. Says nothing meaningful.

### 4. Engagement Potential (1-5)
- 5: People will want to respond, debate, or share.
- 3: Likeable but won't spark conversation.
- 1: Dead end. Nothing to respond to.

### 5. Platform Fit (1-5)
- 5: Perfect for the platform's culture and format.
- 3: Works but not optimized.
- 1: Wrong tone/length for the platform.

**Minimum score: 15/25 to publish. Below 15 = revise or kill.**

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### X/Twitter
- **Length:** Punchy. Under 200 chars ideal, 280 max.
- **Tone:** Direct, witty, slightly provocative OK.
- **Format:** Single thought. Thread only if genuinely multi-part.
- **Avoid:** Corporate speak, empty motivation, hashtag spam.

### LinkedIn
- **Length:** 150-300 words. Substantial but scannable.
- **Tone:** Professional but human. No buzzword bingo.
- **Format:** Hook → Story/Insight → Takeaway. Line breaks matter.
- **Avoid:** Humble brags, engagement bait ("Agree?"), AI detection triggers.

## Red Flags (Auto-reject)

- Starts with "I" (rewrite the hook)
- Contains "game-changer", "revolutionary", "excited to announce"
- Generic advice with no specific experience behind it
- Asks for engagement without earning it ("Thoughts?")
- Could be written by any AI assistant
- No clear point or takeaway

## Performance Tracking

After posting, log:
- Platform
- Post time (day/hour)
- Content type (insight, story, hot take, question, thread)
- Score given pre-publish
- Results at 24h: impressions, engagements, replies
- Results at 7d: same metrics
- Notes: what worked, what didn't

Over time, correlate pre-publish scores with actual performance to improve the scoring system.
