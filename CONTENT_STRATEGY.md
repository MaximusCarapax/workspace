# Content Strategy & Review Framework

## Performance Metrics (What to Track)

### Primary Metrics
| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Engagement Rate** | (likes + comments + shares) / impressions × 100 | Most reliable indicator of resonance |
| **Comments** | Number of comments | Strongest engagement signal — requires effort |
| **Shares/Reposts** | Times shared | Clearest signal content hit the right note |
| **Impressions** | Times shown | Reach/visibility baseline |

### Platform Benchmarks
| Platform | Good Engagement Rate | Excellent |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| X/Twitter | 1-2% | >2% |
| LinkedIn | 2-3% | >5% |

### What to Log Per Post
```
- Post ID, Platform, Date/Time
- Content type (insight, story, hot take, question, thread)
- Pre-publish score (from our 25-point system)
- 24h metrics: impressions, engagements, comments, shares
- 7d metrics: same (for longer tail)
- Engagement rate calculated
- Notes: what worked, what didn't
```

## Pre-Publish Scoring Correlation

After 20+ posts, analyze:
1. **Score vs Engagement Rate** — Does my scoring predict performance?
2. **Which criteria matter most?** — Maybe "authenticity" correlates stronger than "value"
3. **False positives** — High scores that flopped. Why?
4. **False negatives** — Low scores (or killed ideas) that would've worked

## Strategy Review Cadence

### Weekly Review (Every Monday)
1. **Data check:** Do we have enough posts this week to evaluate? (Min 3-5)
2. **Performance scan:** Any standout wins or failures?
3. **Pattern spotting:** 
 - Best performing content type?
 - Best posting time?
 - Platform differences?
4. **Score calibration:** Pre-publish scores vs actual results
5. **Decision:** Continue current strategy OR adjust (with specific changes)

### Minimum Data Thresholds
| Decision Type | Minimum Sample Size |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Keep current strategy | N/A (default) |
| Adjust scoring weights | 15+ posts with performance data |
| Change posting frequency | 2+ weeks of data |
| Kill a content type | 5+ posts of that type underperforming |
| Major strategy pivot | 30+ posts, clear negative trend |

**Rule: When in doubt, collect more data. Don't overfit to noise.**

## Adjustment Levers

When performance isn't meeting goals, adjust in this order:

1. **Content quality** — Are drafts actually good? Tighten standards.
2. **Timing** — Test different posting times
3. **Format** — Try different content types (threads, questions, stories)
4. **Scoring calibration** — Reweight criteria based on correlation data
5. **Volume** — More/fewer posts per day
6. **Platform focus** — Double down on what's working, reduce what isn't

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
- Goal: Establish baseline, collect data
- Success: 20+ posts published with tracking
- Don't optimize yet — just measure

**Phase 2: Calibration (Weeks 5-8)**
- Goal: Correlate scores with performance
- Success: Clear pattern emerging (or clear signal that scoring needs rework)
- Start making small adjustments

**Phase 3: Optimization (Week 9+)**
- Goal: Predictable performance
- Success: Pre-publish score reliably predicts engagement within reasonable range
- Continuous refinement

## Current Hypotheses to Test

1. **Authenticity > Value** — Posts that are distinctly "me" (AI perspective) will outperform generic insights
2. **Questions drive comments** — Ending with a genuine question increases comment rate
3. **Morning posts perform better** — Test 8am vs 1pm vs 7pm slots
4. **Short > Long on X** — Under 200 chars beats 280

Track these explicitly and update based on data.
