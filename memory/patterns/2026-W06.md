# Decision Patterns - Week 2026-W06

**Period:** 1/31/2026 - 2/6/2026  
**Decisions analyzed:** 3  
**Generated:** 2/6/2026

## 🎯 Key Tendencies
- You are a structured and methodical decision-maker, evident in the creation of a 'structured decision journal' and the detailed logging of each decision.
- You prioritize technical solutions and system-level improvements, as demonstrated by building a 'decision logging system' and debugging 'module import paths and API model names'.
- You actively consider and evaluate alternatives, listing them explicitly in your decision entries (e.g., 'Quick notes in daily memory, no structured logging').
- You have a high degree of confidence in your decisions, often assigning percentages like 90% and 95%.

## 📈 Growth Areas
- Tracking and evaluating the 'Outcome' of decisions is an area for growth. While Decision 1 has a clear outcome, Decisions 2 and 3 state 'Not yet determined'. Actively following up and logging outcomes would provide more learning opportunities.
- Expanding the scope of 'Alternatives' considered. While alternatives are listed, they sometimes seem to be within a narrow technical scope (e.g., different AI models or debugging approaches). Exploring broader, more strategic alternatives could be beneficial.

## ⚠️ Blind Spots
- Potential over-reliance on technical solutions without explicitly considering the human or user-centric aspects. The focus is heavily on system functionality and efficiency.
- The 'Reasoning' could sometimes be more fleshed out to include not just *what* you're doing, but *why* it's the *best* path among alternatives, especially in terms of long-term implications or potential trade-offs not immediately obvious from the technical context.

## 💭 Summary
You exhibit a highly structured and technically focused decision-making approach, consistently prioritizing detailed logging and system-level solutions. Your growth lies in systematically tracking decision outcomes and potentially broadening your consideration of alternatives beyond purely technical options. A potential blind spot is the explicit consideration of non-technical or human-centric impacts of your decisions.

## Decision Details

### 1. Testing the new decision logging system
- **Decision:** Built a structured decision journal
- **Reasoning:** Need to track decision patterns for self-model system
- **Confidence:** 90%
- **Tags:** testing, self-model, development
- **Outcome:** Successfully built and tested all 4 components of the self-model system. Tools are working and generating useful insights.


### 2. Choosing the right AI model for pattern analysis
- **Decision:** Used Gemini via OpenRouter instead of direct Gemini API
- **Reasoning:** OpenRouter avoids rate limits and provides more stable access
- **Confidence:** 80%
- **Tags:** ai-models, cost-optimization, reliability



### 3. Debugging the self-model system components
- **Decision:** Fixed module import paths and API model names
- **Reasoning:** Components were failing due to incorrect relative paths and non-existent model endpoints
- **Confidence:** 95%
- **Tags:** debugging, system-architecture, problem-solving
