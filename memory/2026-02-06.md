## Friction Log

### 1. Compaction Recovery (High)
**What:** Session started with "Summary unavailable" — had to manually reconstruct context
**Impact:** Lost ~5 min recovering, risk of missing important context
**Suggestion:** Automated post-compaction recovery checklist or auto-chunk before compaction

### 2. Misleading Embedding Errors (Medium)  
**What:** Errors said "25k-75k tokens" but actual issue was corrupt binary data
**Impact:** Debugged wrong problem initially
**Suggestion:** Add content validation before embedding, better error messages

### 3. Timezone Confusion (Low)
**What:** UTC timestamps in Telegram, I calculated Melbourne time wrong
**Impact:** Minor embarrassment, no real cost
**Suggestion:** Auto-include Melbourne time in my mental model

### 4. No Systematic Idea Capture (High)
**What:** Ideas emerge during work but no habit of logging them
**Impact:** Ideas lost, only surface when Jason asks
**Suggestion:** End-of-session idea sweep or friction capture tool

## Session Summary (Pre-Compaction Flush ~03:25 UTC)

### Major Shipments Tonight
1. **Self-Observation System** - Weekly digest cron (Sundays 9pm Melbourne)
2. **Contextual RAG Enhancement** - Context prepending, hybrid search, LLM topic extraction
3. **Self-Model System** - Decision journal, pattern analysis, identity evolution tracker
4. **Post-compaction recovery** - `tools/post-compaction-recovery.js`
5. **Friction capture tool** - `tools/log-friction.js` + `tools/synthesize-friction.js`
6. **Smart X Mentions** - Scoring, categorization, relationship tracking → LIVE
7. **Voice Agent Enhancement** - All 4 stories done → LIVE
   - Context strategy, Call→RAG, hang_up support, appointments
   - Calendar write scope configured via phone OAuth flow

### Technical Fixes
- Fixed RAG "oversized chunk" errors - actually corrupted binary data, not size
- Added corruption detection (>50% non-ASCII) + truncation safeguards
- Extended contacts table with relationship, preferences, total_calls, last_call

### Specs Written
- `specs/self-model-system.md` - Decision tracking, identity evolution
- `specs/smart-x-mentions.md` - Mention scoring pipeline
- `specs/voice-agent-enhancement.md` - Full voice agent spec

### Key Decisions Logged
- Calendar-based weekly analysis (syncing with Jason's time, not session-count)
- Identity evolution visible to Jason (transparency > secrecy)
- Appointments require verbal confirmation
- Single calendar with [Max] prefix for my events

### External Observation (from Jason)
"Previously you'd send multiple messages one after another and forget... now you're able to follow up on your previous message"
- Logged to identity-evolution.md
- Hypotheses: better delegation, better tools, deliberate tracking

### In Progress When Compacted
- Hume auto-transcript retrieval (sub-agent building)
- Kevin Zhang call completed (89 sec) - awaiting transcript to book meeting
- Opus 4.6 research - released Feb 5, has "agent teams" feature, 1M context

### Pending Actions
- Book Kevin's visit + send invite to kevin@zgk.com.au (once transcript arrives)
- Consider upgrading to Opus 4.6 (agent teams, 1M context)
