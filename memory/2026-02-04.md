# 2026-02-04 (Evening Session)

## Major Builds Shipped

### Pipeline Templates System
- Created `spec-writer`, `builder`, `reviewer` templates in `templates/agents/`
- All templates now auto-persist their work:
  - Specs → `specs/{name}.md`
  - Build notes → `memory/builds/{date}-{name}.md`
  - Reviews → `memory/reviews/{date}-{name}.md`
- Builder template includes **delegation rules** — must use aider/DeepSeek for coding, not write code directly

### Activity Logging System
- Built `lib/activity.js` with unified API
- Enhanced CLI: `node tools/db.js activity --category X --since Y`
- Passed review 9/9 criteria
- Spec: `specs/activity-logging-system.md`

### Cost Alerting
- Built `tools/cost-alert.js`
- Alerts via SMS when daily spend exceeds threshold ($150 default)
- Max 1 alert per day (no spam)
- Passed review 6/6 criteria

### X Post Dedup
- Added duplicate detection to `tools/x-post.js`
- Uses Jaccard similarity (60% threshold)
- **Migrated tracking to SQLite** `social_posts` table (was JSON file)
- Blocks duplicates with `--force` override option

## Heartbeat Redesign
- Rewrote `HEARTBEAT.md` as **silent worker model**
- Now includes: cost sync, health check, social scan, email quick check (afternoons), Reddit pulse, stale task detection
- Fixed Haiku 4.5 model name: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (not `-latest`)
- Moved Email Afternoon + Reddit Pulse from cron to heartbeat

## Cron Cleanup
- Removed prank call job (was disabled)
- Fixed 2 PM conflict — Email moved to 2:15 PM
- Updated Night Shift + Morning Briefing to use SQLite tasks (was Linear)
- Now 13 active cron jobs

## Process Improvement System
- Created `memory/friction.md` — real-time friction capture
- Created `memory/incidents/` — post-incident write-ups
- Updated Weekly Review cron with **5-min retro section**
- Feedback loop: Daily friction → Weekly retro → Process improvements

## Terminology Decision
- Keeping it **lean** (not Agile)
- Feature → Steps (not Epic → Stories)
- No ceremony needed

## Documentation Fixes
- Updated `TOOLS.md` — fixed stale "Gemini free" and "$0.14/M DeepSeek" references
- Updated `docs/SUBAGENT_GUIDELINES.md` — added aider delegation, correct pricing

## Specs Pending Build
- `specs/second-brain-embeddings.md` (~11h) — waiting approval

## Known Issues
- LinkedIn cookies expired (security challenge)
- Gmail token needs refresh
- Daily cost hit $150.76 (alert triggered)

## Session Cost
~$150+ total for the day (heavy building session)
