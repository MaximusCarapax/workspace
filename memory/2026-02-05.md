## Trade Invoice Pipeline (Glazier Quotes)

**Project:** Build tool to extract glazier items from construction docs → generate quotes

**Client requirement:** qty and sizes for frameless showers, mirrors, glass balustrades, glass doors

**Documents:**
- `data/invoice-project/specifications.pdf` - item codes, specs, locations
- `data/invoice-project/drawings_1.pdf` & `drawings_2.pdf` - architectural drawings with dimensions
- `data/invoice-project/invoice_sample.pdf` - target output format (grouped by floor)

**Progress:**
1. Built text-based specs-extractor.js (103 items extracted)
2. Pivoted to vision AI approach (dimensions are in drawings, not specs)
3. First builder created vision-extractor.js with image conversion
4. Spawned refactor sub-agent to use native PDF input (no image conversion)

**Vision AI Research Results:**
| Model | Input $/M | Output $/M | Vision | PDF Native |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------|------------|
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 | $10.00 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 | $2.50 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $3.00 | $15.00 | ✅ | ✅ |
| GPT-4o | $2.50 | $10.00 | ✅ | ❌ |

**Recommendation:** Gemini 2.5 Pro via OpenRouter - native PDF, good accuracy, best value

## Sub-agent Guidelines Update

Added to `subagents/guidelines.md`:
- Brave Search API has 1 req/sec rate limit (Free plan)
- Do NOT fire multiple web_search calls in same tool block
- Stagger searches ~2 seconds apart (separate tool blocks)

## Backlog Additions
- #32: Dashboard refactor: Plain HTML → Vite + React + Tailwind
- #33: Backlog enhancement: Add feature/project grouping field

## Active Sub-agents
- `pdf-refactor` - Refactoring vision-extractor to use native PDF input via Gemini 2.5 Pro

## Tech Stack (Confirmed)
- Frontend: Vite + React (or SvelteKit)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js or Hono
- CLI tools: Node.js (fine as-is)
- Dashboard currently NOT aligned (plain HTML)
