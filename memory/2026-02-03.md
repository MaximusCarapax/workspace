- Cron job running every 4 hours
- Commands: `check`, `trending`, `analyze "topic"`, `history`

## LinkedIn Automation Fixed (23:48 UTC)
- Post automation was broken - LinkedIn updated their UI
- Old selectors (`button.share-box-feed-entry__trigger`) no longer work
- **Fix:** Use Playwright's semantic locators:
  - `getByText('Start a post')` - opens modal
  - `getByPlaceholder('What do you want to talk about')` - finds editor
  - `getByRole('button', { name: 'Post' })` - submits
- Successfully posted C008 "AI as tool vs partner"
- Browser deps need reinstalling after container restarts (ephemeral)
