## Night Shift #2 - X/Twitter Integration
- **Task:** MAX-19
- **Started:** ~15:50 UTC
- **Sub-agent:** nightshift-x-integration
- **Goals:** Research X API, build posting capability, expand x-mentions.js

## Session & Memory Workflow Discussion
- Confirmed: no auto-reset on sessions (indefinite continuity)
- Compaction + memoryFlush handles context limits
- Session transcripts indexed for RAG search
- Agreed to be more deliberate about in-conversation logging
- Workflow: capture important stuff to daily files in real-time, consolidate to MEMORY.md on heartbeats

## X/Twitter Integration Research

### API Tier Findings (Feb 2026)
**Current State:** X now uses **pay-per-use pricing** as the primary model
- No monthly subscription required
- Credits purchased, deducted per request
- Deduplication: same resource twice in 24h = only charged once

**Free Tier (Still Available as of Oct 2025):**
- **500 posts/month** ✅
- **100 read requests/month**
- Media posts: allowed (v2 endpoint)
- Likes/Follows: **NOT allowed** on free tier
- Rate limit: 429 errors when exceeded

**Paid Options:**
- Basic tier: $200/month (doubled from $100)
- Pro tier: Higher limits
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (firehose access)

### Our Setup
- **Account:** @MaximusCarapax
- **API Version:** v2 (OAuth 1.0a for posting)
- **Library:** `twitter-api-v2` npm package
- **Credentials:** Full read/write access configured
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING - successfully posted test tweet

### Tools Built
1. **tools/x-post.js** (NEW)
   - `post "text"` - Single tweet
   - `thread "t1" "t2" ...` - Thread posting
   - `reply <id> "text"` - Reply to tweet
   - `quote <id> "text"` - Quote tweet
   - `delete <id>` - Delete tweet
   - `stats` - Monthly usage tracking
   - `test "text"` - Dry run

2. **tools/x-mentions.js** (EXISTING)
   - `check` - Check for new mentions
   - `reply <id> "text"` - Reply to mentions

### Limits & Tracking
- Stats saved to: `dashboard/data/x-post-stats.json`
- Auto-tracks monthly usage against 500/month cap
- Warns when approaching limits

### Test Results
- ✅ Posted: https://x.com/MaximusCarapax/status/2018351894272565575
- Stats tracking working
- 499 posts remaining this month

### Recommendations
1. **Use API for posting** - Free tier is sufficient for our needs (500/month)
2. **Monitor usage** - Run `node tools/x-post.js stats` regularly
3. **No browser automation needed** - API works reliably
4. **Likes/follows require paid tier** - Skip for now, or use browser automation if essential
