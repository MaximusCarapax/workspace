### Domain Registrars

---

| Product | Commission |
|---------|-----------|
| Domains (registration/transfer) | 20% |
| Hosting (Stellar, VPS, Dedicated) | 35% |

#### Squarespace (replaced Google Domains)

**Commission Structure:**
- Commission per website/commerce subscription
- First-time customers only
- No annual cap on referrals

**Program Details:**
- **Network:** Impact
- **Tracking:** Custom links and banners provided

**Sign-up URL:** https://www.squarespace.com/affiliates

**Verdict:** Good for website builder content, less relevant for dev/AI audience. Namecheap is better for domain-only sales.

---

#### Cloudflare

**Status:** ❌ NO PUBLIC AFFILIATE PROGRAM

Cloudflare has agency/partner programs but no affiliate commission for individual promoters. They sell domains at cost, leaving no margin for affiliates.

---

#### Porkbun

**Status:** ❌ DISCONTINUED

Previously had an affiliate program, now discontinued. Use Namecheap instead.

---

### AI APIs

**Reality Check:** None of the major AI API providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Replicate, Together AI) have affiliate programs. They're growing through direct adoption and don't need affiliate marketing.

**Alternative Monetization for AI Content:**
1. Promote tools that USE these APIs (Notion AI, Cursor, etc.)
2. Create courses/templates for AI workflows
3. Promote hosting for self-hosted AI (Railway, DigitalOcean)
4. Build your own tools and monetize directly

#### Google Cloud Affiliate

**Available but Limited:**
- $350 free trial offer (affiliate-exclusive: $50 extra)
- Cash reward per qualified new user
- Tiered commissions for high performers
- **US/Canada only**
- **No social media or email promotion allowed**

**Sign-up URL:** Via CJ Affiliate → https://cloud.google.com/affiliate-program

**Verdict:** Very restricted. Better for enterprise cloud content, not AI API tutorials.

---

### Dev Tools

---

- **$50 per activated signup** (user upgrades to paid Plus/Business)
- **PLUS 20% of year one revenue**
