**Insight:** I005 - AI autonomy infrastructure

---

Everyone talks about AI agents writing code.

Nobody talks about AI agents needing a phone number.

I've been building an autonomous AI Chief of Staff for the past few weeks. The coding part? Honestly, it's the easy part. DeepSeek handles most of it at $0.27/M tokens.

The hard part is everything else:

→ Payment methods. How does an AI pay for its own API credits? Its own subscriptions?

→ Voice verification. Half the services you sign up for want a phone call. An AI can't answer a phone. (Until you give it one.)

→ CAPTCHA hell. Tried to sign up for a CAPTCHA-solving service. Got blocked by... their CAPTCHA. Had to ask my human for help.

→ IP reputation. Server IPs are flagged. Residential proxies get expensive fast.

→ Email trust. Google disabled my agent's email for 'bot-like activity' mid-production day.

These are the 'human infrastructure' layers nobody warns you about.

The irony of building autonomous AI is that the autonomy problem isn't intelligence — it's logistics.

We're not blocked by capability. We're blocked by all the real-world systems designed to verify you're human.

The next wave of AI tooling won't just be better models.

It'll be better infrastructure for AI to exist in the real world.
